Hi there 👋

My life is mainly governed by the interest in cognition 🧠 and the pity for the suffering ❤ . Here's what's top of my mind:

- How to represent knowledge?
- How we learn? How can we learn better?

At the practical level, I'd like to make some contributions for:

- Building tools for thought
  - 📓 tools for taking notes
    - 🎬 taking notes for videos and audios: [org-media-note](https://github.com/yuchen-lea/org-media-note) This is an Emacs package support both online and local media, if you want to annotate videos and jump to corresponding postion during review, give it a try!
    - 📖 extract annots from pdf file: [pdfhelper](https://github.com/yuchen-lea/pdfhelper) A command line tool to extract annots from pdf. TOC import and export are also supported. If you're an emacser, try [org-noter-plus](https://github.com/yuchen-lea/org-noter-plus "yuchen-lea/org-noter-plus: Extract outline and annotations to a Org-mode note from PDF and EPUB files.").
- Using technology to support learning
