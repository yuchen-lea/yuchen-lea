Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My life is mainly governed by the interest in cognition and the pity for the suffering. Here's what's top of my mind:

- How to represent knowledge?
- How we learn? how can we learn better?

At the practical level, I'd like to make some contributions for:

- Building tools for thought
- Using technology to support learning
