Hi there üëã

My life is mainly governed by the interest in cognition üß† and the pity for the suffering ‚ù§ . Here's what's top of my mind:

- How to represent knowledge?
- How do we learn? How can we learn better?

At the practical level, I'd like to make some contributions for:

- Building tools for thought
  - üé¨ Take notes for videos and audios: [org-media-note](https://github.com/yuchen-lea/org-media-note) This is an Emacs package support both online and local media, if you want to annotate videos and jump to corresponding postion during review, give it a try!
  - üìñ Extract annots from pdf file: [pdfhelper](https://github.com/yuchen-lea/pdfhelper) A command line tool to extract annots from pdf. TOC import and export are also supported. If you're an emacser, try [org-noter-plus](https://github.com/yuchen-lea/org-noter-plus "yuchen-lea/org-noter-plus: Extract outline and annotations to a Org-mode note from PDF and EPUB files.").
- Using technology to support learning
  - I have been working as product manager in Edtech companies for years, with the belief that we could make the world a better place through technology and education.
  - I'm trying to achieve this by:
    - Design good interactions to make the learning process easy and fun.
    - Utilize data to provide learners with the most suitable learning stuff.
